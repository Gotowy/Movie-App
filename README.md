# netFilmoteka - movie browsing portal (under construction)

netFilmoteka is a personal project where main purpose was to build a React application which uses a complex third part API in case to create some functional and useful web site. While working on the project I also incorporated Redux because of reaching the point where dependencies between component states started to seem a little vailed. 

## Built with:
HTML i CSS (flex-box, grid, media queries)<br />
JavaScript<br />
React (React-Router-DOM)<br />
Redux (Thunk)<br />
Axios<br />
TMDb API<br />
Google fonts<br />
Font awsome<br />

## Functionality:
The web site allows to browse movies figuring in The Movie Database by full or part of their names (multiple languages allowed). There is also possibility of searching movies by genre or filter them by certain criterium and check for more details about chosen movie in an individual component. The project has implemented pagination and is responsive.


## Status:
For now the project can be recognized as completed but I plan on adding some extra features sometime in the future (e.g. extending information about a chosen movie, more filtering parameters, language change possibility or even enabling user accounts).
